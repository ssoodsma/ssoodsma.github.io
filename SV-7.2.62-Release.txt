      SVM8123I Host Window Caption changed from 'Old Name' to 'New Name' by TID=xxxx

NEW:  When creating a remote host window, an extra check is made to ensure the 
      window's name is set.

MOD:  Host Windows will now have an initial name that contains "Not Named".
      Once SV has determined the access level for that window (Read Only, Write, etc...)
      the name will be changed.  The old initial name of the window was blank.

Release 7.2.35.1                                 September 14, 2011
===============================================================
NEW:  REXX Function SvFlushHostCommands(Host_Name) will move the
      host's command reader thread to the latest command in the host log, 
      thereby skipping all commands in between. This is useful for when
      a 3270 emulation's command input queue is filled and the 
      host's writer thread becomes backed-up while it waits for
      room in the 3270's queue to become available.

NEW:  REXX CoaxPress now supports "reconnect" for 3270 emulations.
      This command is equivalent to pressing the reconnect button
      on the 3270's toolbar.

NEW:  Under a 3270 emulation's Options->Host dialog, there is a 
      checkbox labeled "Allow Priority Commands".  If enabled, this
      option will cause SVLite remote hosts to have their issued
      commands entered to the host window and 3270 window
      (on the server) at a higher priority.  This is useful
      if there are many automation-issued commands queued to 
      the emulation and you desire to have operator-issued commands 
      faster entry.

MOD:  Commands issued from REXX now contain the ASID in the REXX tracing
      file.

NEW:  REXX CoaxPress "enable_priority_commands" and "disable_priority_commands"
      These will enable or disable the priority commands option for the
      specified emulation.


Release 7.2.34.1                                  July 11, 2011

===============================================================
FIX:  The "Do not load log files larger than x" option could lead to 
      logs being overwritten.

FIX:  An error message, "Corrupted TN3270 Server Directory List (ServerList1) 
      directory on SecureAgent server" would appear in the SV Messages 
      log when making a New Secure TN3270 connection.

FIX:  The rename window dialog allows canceling.

FIX:  SV properly checks existing window names when creating 3215 windows to
      ensure no naming conflict.

FIX:  Creating a new NT Admin window uses the remote hostname to name the
      window instead of the IP address.

NEW:  A dialog box is presented when starting SV if SV does not have 
      access to its own folder.  SV must be able to read and write
      to its own folder.

FIX:  Scrolling past around the 60000th message in a host window does not
      result in the scroll thumb jumping to an undesired location.

Release 7.2.31.1                                  February 25, 2011

===============================================================
MOD:  SV ECP (external command processor) will now run in its own
  REXX task thread.  This prevents possible lockups of SV's main thread
  due to the main thread running REXX code.  ECP commands start with 
  a dot '.' by default, such as '.stop' and '.rexx'.

FIX: SQL query in REXX yielding large results could hang the exec.

FIX: SQL query in REXX yielding more than 256 affected rows

  than 3 seconds the following message will be put into the SuperVision
  messages log:

  This is useful for tracking when network drives are unresponsive
  if, for example, your REXX path contains such drives.

NEW: At SV login time, SV will attempt to authenticate the user in
  this order:
  
  1. Use SecureAgent on localhost if SA is installed.
  2. Use the SNS1 server defined in SV's SNS/SDS dialog
  3. Use the SNS2 server defined in SV's SNS/SDS dialog
  4. allow access since no SA on localhost and no SNS/SDS is setup

MOD: Changing your password from within SV, either because it expired
  or by manually invoking password change from the File menu,
  will result in the SNS/SDS and IP Node List passwords to be
  updated for that user.

FIX:  Command Scheduler update dialog does not attempt a localhost SA 
      login to verify Admin access for every open host window. 

MOD:  Emulation windows will wait up to 2 seconds for the emulation
      reader to quit. The previous wait was 5 seconds.

MOD:  If a host window title is ever set to empty, an attempt to 
      properly name the window will be made.

FIX:  On newer Windows OS releases (Vista and Windows 7 based) the main

============================================================
NEW:  "Change Password..." File menu item.  If SA is installed 
      on the same SV machine, then the change password request
      will be forwarded to it.  If SA is not installed then
      the defined SDS/SNS servers will be used.

FIX:  SV SNS to CUD connections could leave benign 10054 
      error messages in the SA log.

FIX:  Non-secure 3270 failed automatic reconnect attempts

FIX:  Remote SV Groups dialog was using the Host Session access
      for all device types.

MOD:  Remote Host, 3270, VTxx, and 5250 dialogs
      will now automatically select the first node
      and the node's first session if "resolve all nodes"
      is enabled when entering the dialog.

FIX:  Remote connection dialogs do not consider
      case when determining if an existing session exists.

Release 7.2.6.1                                 June 10, 2009

      during a network connection attempt, there was a 
      chance for an exception.

MOD:  Delays during SV shutdown are avoided when SV is sending
      status to SNS.

NEW:  When the SCP throttles message flow to a remote client
      it will send an SCP0023E message to the SV message window.
      
FIX:  GetDataList with SessionInfo could cause an exception. 

Release 7.2.4.2                                 May 26, 2009
============================================================
MOD:  Default options are stored per user. Previously
      default options were stored per window profile.

      The first time a user logs with this new version,
      the old version's default options for that user's
      profile will be migrated.

MOD:  If a client SV connection is not able to keep up with
      the server SV's flow of messages, the server
      will throttle the flow of messages.  This
      prevents possible message loss on the client.

FIX:  REXX SvSetHostConnection() will switch host input
      for remote host 2 windows.

FIX:  Setting a 3215's name to default works as

FIX:  Remote host window's name is set by the server host window when
      the server's window name changes.

NEW:  Automation Rules editor now has a color "Original".
      This allows you to set a message to an Alert type

MOD:  The Name "default" is added to the list
      of reserved session names, such as COAX1 and VTXX1.

============================================================
FIX:  Closing a remote emulation while it is attempting
      a connection that will always fail (bad address, bad 
      session name, etc) does not lock the SuperVision UI.

FIX:  Turning off the Main Option "Indicate Old-Style Host-ID"

      exception on SV shutdown.  This exception had no impact on the operation of SV. 

FIX:  Changing the host name of a 3215 window to "default" will cause the window
      to be renamed to its LUName.

FIX:  It was possible for a Remote Host 2 window to have multiple connections to the
      same SV server resulting in duplicate messages.

FIX:  REXX sourceline() would return the wrong number of lines in some cases.

NEW:  REXX GetDataList with the "SessionInfoEx" returns detailed infomation for
      host windows.  An example is:
      x = GetDataList("SessionInfoEx", "stem") for remote host 2 windows will show:
      stem.0 = 4
      stem.1 = remote host
      stem.2 = window name
      stem.3 = session1@host1 (ip address of host1)
      stem.4 = session2@host2 (ip address of host2)
      
MOD:  If a remote SV connection could not be established during a profile
      load, the remaining connections will be attempted.

NEW:  SuperVision's address space map is dumped at startup and at midnight. 
      It is also dumped every minute when trace core is set to 4. SVM7612I 
      is the message prefix.

FIX:  A memory leak in SCP has been corrected.  This leak happens
      when thousands of messages are generated on a host window in a 
      short period of time and there exist connected remote clients to
      that host window.

MOD   Default options now has auto-reconnect set to on.  Retry count is 
      forever and retry seconds is 10. 

FIX:  REXX Random() caused an exception if the second argument was zero.

      number of seconds from the last successful network connection.

FIX:  New IDG9074 connections that use a gateway now work.

MOD:  The SV Alert Manager window no longer has the forwarding tab.  
      Old-style alrert forwarding has been removed.  This refers to
      when SV's AM window would forward alerts to a remote AM's window
      based on the forwarding tab options of the AM window.

MOD:  Sv does not check for the presence of MS terminal services(TS).  This means
      the GIS3270 (coax card) driver will attempt to connect to any
      supported present coax adapters if TS is installed.

NEW:  SvGroups allows two servers under Main Options.

MOD:  Network code for remote SuperVision connections has been enhanced.  Remote connections
      now complete faster between SV clients and SV servers.  You'll notice the
      speed increase most when loading a profile with many remote connections.

MOD: TraceCore 3 will print REXX global stats every minute in SV message window.

MOD: TraceCore 3 will print REXX function stats every minute in SV message window.

MOD: If REXX Send/Msg cannot find the target session, then a list of sessions
     that were found is dumped to the SV message window.

FIX: A race condition could cause REXX Send/Msg to not find the target session even
     when it exists.

Release 7.2.2.2									               March 18, 2009

===============												         ================
NEW:  REXX CoaxPress now allows the special key "flush" to be sent.  This causes
	  the 3270's 4K input buffer to be flushed.

MOD:  REXX LineIn, LineOut, RecordIn, and RecordOut now send trace information
	  to the dog file that is prefixed with "Trace: FileOperation:".  The
	  information that is intended to help diagnose which file's are being
	  accessed especially true for REXX execs that don't use absolute pathing
	  in their calls to these REXX functions.

MOD:  Previously, REXX Send and Msg calls that resulted in a network timeout
      had the chance of being forcefully terminated.  This resulted in a small
	  memory leak for each force.  Now we never force terminate these resources.

FIX:  A deadlock condition is fixed that was triggered by a network error at the
      same time an SV remote session was sending a heartbeat to its server session.

MOD:  Threads logged in SV exception files are now logged with descriptive names.

FIX:  For TN3270 dialogs, changing the keyboard type to anything but 3270 is 
      now prohibited.  The options dialog has these items disabled for TN3270
	  sessions.

FIX:  The New IDG9074 dialog would not remember the selected 3270 model. This
      is now corrected.

MOD:  Compiled with SA 3.6.36.  This level of SecureAgent address an issue when
	  connecting through a gateway and getting "could not decrypt" messages.

NEW:  REXX start thread messages in the SV message log are now appended with
	  a crc32 hash of the REXX file.  This is to help track changes in
	  automation.

NEW:  In any cases where a REXX exec calls Terminate, a SVM5438I message is logged
	  to the SuperVision messages log.

FIX:  REXX function XRange consumed resources for every all.

NEW:  SV's IP Node List has a "Title" field that allows one to arbitrarily
	  name the list entry.  For now this is used only by REXX Send/Msg. That
	  is, you can specify the Title of an IP Node List entry as the first
	  argument to REXX Send and REXX Msg.

	  the same session id (S, A-P) as the sender.
FIX:  REXX Msg/Send to a remote window with a hostid of 26 would fail.  This is
	  a server-side issue.
NEW:  REXX function AM_UpdateAlert can now update the alert color, text, and 
	  status.

Release 7.2.0.3                                                September 2, 2008

================                                               ===============
FIX:  Audit disconnect message could result in an exception.
FIX:  REXX Msg/Send supports '*' for the session name.
FIX:  A remote host window could have an incomplete title when created.
FIX:  Removed a deadlock and possible exception condition when closing a 
	  remote session while that session was reconnecting.
FIX:  Default 3270 setting for position cursor.
FIX:  Default 3270 setting for instant replay memory limit.
FIX:  Default 3270 setting for pc enter key as 3270 enter key.
FIX:  Default 3270 setting for UK-localized settings.
MOD:  REXX Terminate() has a better chance of avoiding a memory leak.  However,
	  Terminate() should not be used under normal conditions.  It should only 
	  be used as a last resort.
MOD:  A remote host 2's secondary connection will show up in the usual remote
	  host dialog under existing connections.
NEW:  New REXX functions for use with "remote host 2" windows:
	SVSetHostConnection("session", index)
	SVGetHostConnection("session")

	session is the name of the host window.
	index must be 1 or 2. 1 is for the primary, 2 is for the secondary.

	Return codes:
	Both functions return 0, 1, or 2.
	0 the function call was not successful
	1 the connection is set to the primary at the completion of the function call.
	2 the connection is set to the secondary at the completion of the function call.

================                                               ===============
FIX:  Remote host dialog creation now checked for failed memory allocation. 81900
FIX:  Exception when canceling out of Remote Host 2 dialog.
FIX:  3270 reconnect retry seconds default value is now initially 1 second.  The
	  value was previously undefined.
FIX:  When logging off SV, SV could take an exception when closing a host window
	  that had keygroups active.
MOD:  When logging into SuperVision, SuperVision will wait up-to 40 seconds to
	  contact SA if SecureAgent is installed.  The previous value was 20 seconds.
MOD:  Trace Core set to 3 will show internal results of REXX extract connect in 
	  the SuperVision messages window.

Release 7.1.37.1                                                June 27, 2008
================                                               ===============
FIX:  Host and 3215 remote connect dialogs had a chance of causing an exception when
	  opened.  
FIX:  Memory leak with default host options keygroup string.
FIX:  Memory leak when opening remote host dialog.
FIX:  A REXX in the Speak() function will wait until it is done speaking
	  before being terminated through ".stop".  Without this, the REXX
	  would terminate and the Speak() function would no longer work until
	  SV was restarted.
FIX:  When a TN3270 reconnect thread exits, the thread did not remove
	  its registered name from SV's thread list.
FIX:  Closing a "New" 3270 session could cause an exception while it was
	  making a network connection.
FIX:  GetNetHosts now works through a gateway.
FIX:  Keygroup names longer than 32 characters caused an exception when
	  SV loaded the keygroup file.
FIX:  3270 reconnect default options are now used.
FIX:  Extract Keygroups now formats items correctly with long keygroup
	  names.
MOD:  When a remote session is already reconnecting, changing the retry 
      seconds count in the options dialog will update the existing update thread.
MOD:  The remote session reconnect message now has more information.  It 
	  is formatted:
	  TCP0001W Attempting to reconnect A session B to C (count=D) (delay=E)
	  where A is emulation or host, B is the name of the session, C is
	  the remote node, D is the number of retry attempts left, and 
	  E is the delay between retry attempts.


Release 7.1.36.1                                                May 26, 2008
================                                               ===============
FIX:  Extract Connect would cause an exception if the server's host window
	  was using an internal index greater than 17.
FIX:  The remote host index is no longer assumed to be the same when restoring
	  a connection as it was when the connection was first established.
NEW:  Remote Host 2 connection button is available that allows you to connect
	  to two different remote host windows in the same window.  These host
	  windows can have a different background color set depending on which
	  remote session is active (sending host message data).  The objective
	  is to have a single host window connected to two different sessions for
	  a host.  This is especially useful in TPF environments where there will
	  only be one active connection at a time.  For example, when the TPF
	  falls back to its ALT, you will know immediately, because the background
	  color will change.

Release 7.1.35.1                                                May 7, 2008
================                                               ===============
FIX:	Import and Export of registry settings does not changes SuperVision's
		working directory. This led to "." commands not working.
FIX:	If a script directory is on a network drive and that drive is not available, 
		issuing a command no longer causes a delay.
FIX:    IP Node List names are stripped of spaces before being saved.
FIX:    REXX "procedure" qualifier caused an exception.
MOD:    GetNetHosts now supports "Standard Name-to-IP resolution" if enabled.
FIX:    REXX Node Globals are updated whenever they are assigned.
FIX:    Moving a Node Global to a Host Global deletes the persistent global.
FIX:    Dropping a Global could cause an exception.
FIX:    REXX Procedure and Expose now scope variables correctly.
MOD:    Extract connect for 3215 now returns any LuNames as well as the Window name
NEW:    The new 3215 dialog allows you to set a primary and secondary 3215 connection
		for the same host window.


Release 7.1.34.1                                             November 15, 2007
================                                               ===============
FIX: A deadlock has been removed that involved remote VTxx connections and
     inputting data into that session. 
MOD: Auto Reconnect now will attempt reconnects no matter what the cause for
     the remote disconnection.
NEW: Logs a "SVM0973E The current working directory is" message if SV
     is unable to find SV_ECP0.

Release 7.1.33.1                                               October 2, 2007
================                                               ===============
FIX: REXX Translate now does not cause the exec to exit when passed a NULL
     string.
FIX: REXX SVScheduleAdd caused a small memory leak that has been fixed.
FIX: REXX Send or Msg to the 26th host window would go to the SuperVision 
     Messages window.
FIX: REXX SubWord would not return the last word in a string when 
     it was specified. SubWord("a b c d", 4, 1) would not return "d").
FIX: Automation rules editor fixed an issue where sorting keywords
     could cause a keyitem to be corrupt.

Release 7.1.32.1                                                July 19, 2007
================                                                =============
FIX:  REXX SubWord now works correctly.
MOD:  TN3270 option "Allow non standard Visara Sequence" now also
      changes the input command response behavior for TN3270 sessions.
      (compiled with GIS3270 2.11.001)

Release 7.1.31.4                                                June 27, 2007
================                                                =============
FIX:  DROP works for global node variables as well as local variables.

Release 7.1.31.3                                                June 19, 2007
================                                                =============
FIX:  REXX eqaulity comparison now does not strip spaces off arguments.

Release 7.1.31.2                                                June 5, 2007
================                                                =============
NEW:  SV support for CA-RCS 3270 emulations.
FIX:  REXX Pos() function would return 1 when the first argument was an empty
      string.
FIX:  SNS (SDS) dialog password field does not result in corrupted password
      when using a long password.

Release 7.1.30.1                                               March 13, 2007

Release 7.1.28.1                                               January 30, 2007
================                                               =================
NEW:  SV session groups can be created using SecureAgent Administrator with the
      new SaiSVVB Host Service.  To enable this option in SV, choose the "Use SV
      Groups: Resolve with IP Address/node name of" option under the Main Options
      General tab.

FIX:  Two exception conditions have been corrected.

Release 7.1.27.1                                               December 08, 2006

================                                               =================
NEW:  Added the ability to import and export SuperVision Registry settings via the File
      menu.
FIX:  Fixed a problem caused in 7.1.24.1 when trying to prevent potential SV exceptions.
MOD:  Widened the keygroup name field on the keygroup tab of the host options dialog.

Release 7.1.24.1                                               November 11, 2006
================                                               ==================
FIX:  Fixed a problem where setting the right control key as enter for host windows
      was not being respected.

Release 7.1.23.1                                               October 6, 2006
================                                               ==================
MOD:  Separated the option specifying not to load files over a specified size to
      be independent for .LOG and .DOG files; previously one option was for both.
FIX:  Fixed a problem with get history not always repainting the screen for a
      host window.
FIX:  Fixed a scenario where updating a global variable in REXX with a string
      larger than 255 characters could cause a dead lock.
FIX:  Fixed a problem where opting to not load a log file due to its size when
      getting history old messages could be resent.

Release 7.1.22.2                                               September 19, 2006
================                                               ==================
FIX:  The exception fix for the 3270 autoreconnect in 7.1.22.1 yielded a leak.

Release 7.1.22.1                                               September 15, 2006
================                                               ==================
NEW:  Now SuperVision can be told to not load log files larger than the specified
      MB.
NEW:  A main option to turn on and off the "Resolve All Hosts" behavior of the 
      remote connection dialogs.
MOD:  On 5250 ReadFile failure, the operation will be retried 10 times before 
      doing a POR of the device.
MOD:  The enter key will not "auto repeat" in a host window.  This will prevent
      the enter key from sending many "empty" commands to a host window if the
      key is accidentally held down.
FIX:  Fixed a scenario where an auto reconnect of a 3270 connection could cause
      an exception; this happened when the reader thread was recycled and the
      writer thread was still using resources shared by both.
FIX:  Fixed a scenario where if a REXX could not be created an exception would
      occur when the error message was built.

Release 7.1.21.1                                               August 18, 2006
================                                               ==================
NEW:  Initial Terminal Server support.  If SV is running under the context of
      a terminal server, you will see "Terminal Server Mode" in the titlebar.
      SV should only be used as a client in terminal server mode.  That is,
      SV can make remote connections to an SV server.  For this initial release,
      SecureAgent should not be installed along with SV on the terminal server
      machine which enforces the "client only" role.
NEW:  SV Log path can be specified in the svprof.ini file.  Here is a sample
      entry for that file:

      [SV]
      SVLogPath="c:\svlogs"

      If the log path is invalid or not present, the usual SV log path will
      be used.
NEW:  REXX function SVMenu can be called with "F", and "C" arguments to list any 
      connected users.
FIX:  Pressing escape in a host window could lead to an exception.
FIX:  An SV client would not respect User 0-9 messages from a server.  The messages
      would come in as type "Normal" and origin "SuperVision".  Now if the 
      "use inbound types" option is selected on the client, the correct type of
      User 0-9 is set and the origin will be "Alert".
FIX:  The Host Window "use only one subwindow" option is now correctly loaded. 


Release 7.1.20.1                                               August 4, 2006
================                                               ==================
NEW:  When a REXX workspace grows, a message is logged in the REXX trace window
      "Stack workspace is growing: adding:x, current_size:y, current_items:z"
NEW:  REXX function calls are checked to ensure they leave the workspace
      balanced.  If they do not then a message is logged in the REXX trace window
      "Unbalanced stack for function: x"
FIX:  REXX copies() could cause an exception for calls that resulted in a 
      large string of around 4000 bytes or more.
FIX:  REXX LineOut() would leave data on the REXX workspace stack if the call
      failed.
MOD:  The SuperVision main title bar now shows "SuperVision" first.
MOD:  If the Main Option, "Always put script commands on the command-line" is
      enabled and a script window is open then pressing escape with
      a command on the input line will clear the command.  Another press
      of escape will bring the script window into focus.

Release 7.1.19.1                                               July 25, 2006
================                                               ==================
MOD:  The escape key pressed in a host window will bring the script window
      to the foreground if the script window is open.
NEW:  REXX function Say("text", "color").  The usual colors are supported:
        "White", "Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue", "Magenta", "Cyan", "Gray",
        "Pink", "Mint", "Khaki", "Violet", "Maroon", "Navy", "Orange", "Brown"
MOD:  A host's subwindow positions are remembered so when you open a subwindow
      it will be placed to the position when it was last closed.

Release 7.1.18.1                                               July 7, 2006
================                                               ==================
MOD:  Selecting the host scripts command will restore any minimized script
      window.
NEW:  A main option now allows you to set whether a double click in a script
      window will issue the command or not. This is in the Main Options on the File tab.
NEW:  A main option now allows you always put a command on the command-line.
      This is in the Main Options on the File tab.  This option will also skip
      any commands that have the ++ appended to them.
FIX:  REXX Strip() function now strips all trailing characters.
FIX:  REXX Copies() function now works with copies 0 and 1 specified.
FIX:  REXX Arg() function now returns the requsted argument.
MOD:  REXX DateCalc() function does not exit the REXX exec if invalid input
      is supplied.  The return on bad input is "Error on input to DateCalc".
       

Release 7.1.17.2                                               June 21, 2006
================                                               ==================
FIX: A timing issue could cause two reader threads to be created for the remote
     host on automatic reconnect.  Only one of the threads was active so the 
     other would eventually time out and close the remote connection.

Release 7.1.17.1                                               June 16, 2006
================                                               ==================
NEW: 3215 windows now have an automatic reconnect option.
MOD: Remote host window auto reconnect now trys to reconnect when the
     server host window closes (not an error condition).

Release 7.1.16.1                                               May 16, 2006
================                                               ==================
FIX: REXX Send() and Msg() would cause an exception if sending larger than 512
     bytes of data.  We increased the message size to 1024 and removed the 
     exception condition.  Messages larger than 1024 bytes will be truncated.

Release 7.1.15.1                                               May 1, 2006
================                                               ==================
FIX:  REXX Send() and Msg() functions would block when sending to a machine
      that had SA installed but was not running SV.  The only way to clear
      these REXX tasks was by issuing a .stop command.

Release 7.1.14.1                                               April 18, 2006

MOD:  REXX Extract TASK will now show under task.4 the type of connection that 
  started the exec (such as Remote SVLite).  task.5 will show the userid for any
  remote connection that started the exec and task.6 will show the IP address

        and "Dark Gray"

FIX:  ShellCommand and Plugin support were not able to handle command line
      arguments with spaces in them.  For example, this would not work:

MOD:  Compiled with SA 3.3.6
MOD:  When the Keygroup editor does not recognize a keyword, it will not

      fields.
NEW:  Keygroup Editor has a new checkbox for running REXX autoresponses 
      synchronously.

Release 7.0.38.1                                                February 4, 2005
================                                                ================
FIX:  The change in release 7.0.37 prevented REXX programs to be issued
      from the "Open REXX" dialog box.  This is corrected.
MOD:  The REXX ShellCommand() function used to use the same directory as
      the calling REXX exec to create temporary files.  Now ShellCommand
      will use the directory is specified in the TMP or TEMP
      environment variable.

Release 7.0.37.1                                                February 1, 2005
================                                                ================
MOD:  When a command is entered into a host window SuperVision will take the first
      token from that command and check to see if it is the name of a REXX exec.
      If it is the name of a REXX exec then SV will start that REXX exec and pass
      to that REXX exec the remaining tokens as command-line arguments.

      With this feature, SV allows command-input filtering.  That is, for all of the 
      important and potentially dangerous host commands (for MVS, VM, TPF...) it is
      needed to verify that these commands are formed correctly and will not have
      a negative impact on the host system.  One simply needs to create a REXX exec
      with the name of that command and the logic in that REXX exec can verify the 
      actual command to send to the host.

      This command filtering mentioned is nothing new in SV.

      Some host commands contain characters that are invalid in Windows file names:

         \ / : * ? " < > |

      Commands with these characters in them could not have a corresponding REXX exec
      because that would lead to the REXX exec having an invalid Windows file name.

      Starting in this release, we map the invalid characters to the underscore.  That 
      is, if this is entered (typed or through a script) from a host window:

      su:bz/12 arg<1> arg<2>

      then SV will now convert any invalid characters from the first token "su:bz/12" into
      an underscore "su_bz_12". This way, you can create a REXX program with a valid file
      name to filter this command.  Since the < and > shown in the above example are not
      in the first token, they will be left unchanged.

Release 7.0.36.1                                                January 18, 2005
================                                                =================
FIX:  VM Model 5 with attached host window was not automatically clearing the "More..."
      state.
NEW:  Handles the WM_TIMECHANGE message.  Whenever the PC time is changed, SV will
      send a message to the SV Messages window in this format:
      SVM7321I System date and time has been updated.  Time now is MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.

Release 7.0.35.1                                                December 9, 2004
================                                                ================
FIX:  On an XP machine, if an SV browser window was maximized and then closed, SV
      would take an exception.
MOD:  The New Browser button is now called "New HMC Browser".
MOD:  Alert Manager Forwarding now sends network messages to the SuperVision 
      Messages window and not the specific host window.
MOD:  The spacing between the main toolbar buttons is now the same for all buttons.
NEW:  New REXX plugin called SMBox (for Super Message Box) that shows message

================                                                =================
NEW:  Web browser connections can be established in SV.  The intent of this is
      for connecting to an HMC.  When used in conjunction with SecureAgent's 
      Secure Web DLL, the browser connection to the HMC can be secure and 
      encrypted.

      The install set now prompts for the browser connection type and "Configure
      Host Connection Types..." dialog in SV allows you to enable or disable
      the "New Browser" button and menu item.

      Internet Explorer 4 or greater is required.

FIX:  REXX VtxxPress(reconnect) no longer presents a confirmation dialog box.
NEW:  A new option under a host window's Alert option tab allows you to specify
      where alerts should be forwarded.  The recipient of the alerts is not SuperVision
      but the new stand-alone Alert Manager application.

Release 7.0.31.1                                                October 15, 2004

MOD:  Disable and Enable of auto-response (control-f5 in a host window) now also
      affects scheduled commands to be issued through the SV Command Scheduler.
      If auto-response is enabled, the scheduled command will be issued.  If

MOD:  There is an indication in the host window button bar for whether or not
      scheduled commands will be issued.
MOD:  The reconnect button in an emulation's toolbar, if pressed, will now
      present a confirmation dialog box.

      inactive if this button is pressed.
MOD:  Copy from emulation to clipboard does not permit hidden field data to 
      go to the clipboard.
FIX:  Host windows would not draw correctly unless the option to prefix the local

FIX:  REXX Speak() function now works with SAPI 4 and SAPI 5.  Windows XP comes
      with SAPI 5. Speak() was only working with SAPI 4 before this update.
NEW:  At SuperVision logon, if the users password has expired, as setup in 
      SecureAgent, then SV will present a dialog allowing you to update the password.

Release 7.0.24                                                February 24, 2004
==============                                                =================
FIX: It was possible for a REXX exec to take an exception while assigning
   a value to a non-local (Host or Node global) stem variable.
MOD: Close repeated calls to REXX Msg() and Send() functions are quicker
   for close successive calls as the session name resolution is cached
   for 5 seconds now.
MOD: VTxxPress has added "escape" as a valid key.
NEW: 3270 Emulation options dialog now has settings for disabling the 
   troubleshooting wizard.
NEW: Added an option to show a dialog box when an error occurs while loading
     keygroups; this allows for immediate notification when the loading of a
     keygroup fails as opposed to combing the SuperVision Messages window for
     an error.

Release 7.0.23                                                 February 6, 2004
==============                                                 ================
FIX: Resolved a deadlock that could occur when using REXX to generate alerts.
FIX: SNS client commands from SV to pre 2.18.0 SA servers now work due to the 
   inclusion of SA 3.2.22 client support.
FIX: If a 3215 LU Name was changed on a 9074 or 9240-5 and SV tried to restore
   its connection to the now non-existent LU name, a deadlock could
   occur.
FIX: A 3215 host window could be created that had the same name as an
   existing host window.
FIX: If a 3215 LU is changed from the 9075/9240-5 then SV is notified and
   SV will update its window title and restore information.
MOD: SV compiled with SA 3.2.22 client support.
MOD: Automation Rules editor now uses the external AutoEdit.chm file.
MOD: Automation Rules editor now has an option to reload the currently open log.
MOD: Automation Rules editor now loads the whole log. Before, it was possible that
   only part of the log would be loaded.
MOD: Automation Rules editor now supports the standard keyboard shortcuts
   for cut copy and paste in edit boxes.
MOD: SV REXX function GetNetHosts() now has an optional third parameter
   for specifying if you want the old-style host ID returned.  See the REXX
   help guide for full details.
NEW: SV now uses AutoEditor version 4.4.4.1.
NEW: Compiled SV with GIS3270 2.0.002 support.

Release 7.0.22                                                 January 23, 2004
==============                                                 ================
FIX: If an emulation has an attached scrolling host window, the host window will
   automatically be created when SV is shut down and restarted.

Release 7.0.21                                                 January 22, 2004
==============                                                 ================
FIX: The REXX Ping() function could leak memory and handle resources.  This
   has been corrected.

Release 7.0.20                                                 January 19, 2004
==================                                             ================
FIX: It was possible for the message/status threads associated with REXX Send()
   and Msg() functions to take an exception if the socket connection was suddenly
   dropped and cleaned up by another thread while the message/status thread
   was still using the deleted data.
FIX: VTxx connection in model 2 and 3 could enter a state where 1 past the bottom
   line was used and all other previous messages would scroll off the screen and the
   screen would remain relatively blank.
FIX: Logging off SuperVision with an active Remote VTxx connection would hang
   SuperVision.
FIX: .STOP did not work in 3215 windows with any name or 3270 attached host 
   windows with the string, "at " in their name.
FIX: REXX interpret statement that led to an internal CALL would not exit the
   exec if the CALL label code executed an EXIT.
FIX: The option to use 4 digit years in host windows is now saved and restored
   properly.
FIX: It was possible for a REXX thread to take an exception when the exec was
   exiting. (SVT cleanup code)
MOD: Tooltip keyboard shortcuts were not correct.  Now the tooltips show correct
   keyboard shortcuts.
MOD: REXX Extract HostName now returns two lines of info:
Extract HostName
   HostName.0 = 2
   HostName.1 = "SessionName"
   HostName.2 = "SessionName@Node"
   The HostName.2 line now shows the full session name combined with the originating
   SV Machine after the '@' sign if applicable
MOD: VTS_Mount has been updated:  
x = vts_mount("catalog", "volser", "host", ["device"], "MountResultStem")
There are two differences:
1. device is now optional.  If you omit the device argument, this means we do not care where to mount the device and the catalog should find a suitable device for us.
2. The last argument is new.  If the call is successful then the name passed here will become a populated stem such as:
MountResultStem.0 = 3
MountResultStem.1 = Volser
MountResultStem.2 = Host
MountResultStem.3 = Device
NEW: Window Profiles can now be optionally stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER instead of 
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.  This option is on the Main Option's General tab.

Release 7.0.19                                                 December 5, 2003
==================                                             ================
FIX: The text for the emulation trouble-shooting wizard is now shown.
FIX: It was possible for SV to take an exception while shutting down when an 
   SNS update was active.
FIX: The External Command Processor (ECP) now properly stops REXX execs (.stop) on host 
   windows greater than the 16th one. This was an old SV limit with each host window
   had a name of A-P.
FIX: High 3270 activity on systems that put a "more..." pause between screens
   while a host window was attached to the 3270 emulation would prevent commands
   to be issued to the session while there was more output coming from the host.
   This was due to SV treating the need to automatically clear a "more..." as a 
   higher priority than issuing commands.
FIX: REXX Function DataType now properly returns the correct result for testing
   the empty string and HEX.
MOD: REXX Editor now has color highlighting for StartScript.
MOD: Keywords in keygroups now allow spaces.
MOD: When SV is starting, if SV determines that SecureAgent is installed not running,
   then SV will wait 20 seconds for SA to start.  
MOD: When SV is trying to contact SecureAgent at SV login time, a modal dialog is presented
   stating that SV is trying to contact SecureAgent.
MOD: If a user logged in to SV does not have Admin authority to the SuperVision messages
   window, that user will not be able to change the emulation "command cache" options.
MOD: The "shift" command cache hotkey for emulations has been removed.
MOD: The main option for auto logon has changed so it auto logs in with whichever user last
   logged on.
NEW: Added Host connection types to the Configure Host Connection Types dialog box.  Now,
   the New Host and Remote Host buttons may be hidden.

Release 7.0.18                                                 November 3, 2003
==================                                             ================                                   
FIX: If no "connection types" are selected during the install of SV, the install will
   be allowed to continue.
FIX: If VTxx was not selected during the install for "connection types" then VTxx options
   will not show up in SuperVision.
FIX: Compiled with GIS3270 1.38.006 that corrects a deadlock situation in the TN3270
   engine between a timer thread handling IND$FILE timeouts and Are You There AYT
   processing.
MOD: Now, before the Window Profiles dialog box is displayed a check of the user's
     write privileges are performed and the user is notified if they are restricted
     from updating the window profiles and settings.
MOD: The Alert Manager log now uses a daily log instead of a monthly log.
MOD: A spelling error was fixed on the 3270 Keyboard options dialog.
MOD: SV Core trace level 3 allows a trace message showing what the access was set
   for given host and emulation windows. (Admin, Read Only, etc.)
MOD: 3215 windows are not shutdown when logging off SuperVision.

=====================                                          ================
FIX: If/Else pairing was not respected in REXX; if the user had statements separating the
   if from the else the program would not bail with an error.
FIX: If the primary or backup SDS address was removed, the SNS lamps would not update
   to show that no server is specified.
FIX: A message in the SuperVision messages log stated "SVA0001I Unknown Connecting version..."
   The word unknown has been changed to SuperVision.  This message indicates the different 
   SV clients such as SV, SVLite, SVVB OCX, and SREXX.
FIX: If a remote emulation and host window have the same name on the same remote machine,
   at profile load time, only the emulation would be restored. Now both are restored.
FIX: If a session on two different remote nodes has different names in your saved profile,
   only one of the remote sessions would be restored.  Now both are restored.
FIX: Command restriction was not respected for new host windows that were created while
   logged into SuperVision.  An SV logoff/logon was required to enable command restriction
   for the newly created window.
FIX: The "Allow nonstandard Visara sequence" option is restored at profile load time
   for TN3270 sessions.
FIX: Hardware console keys (3180) issued from SVLite 3.10.4 or greater are now properly
   handled.
FIX: SNMP traps are now sent automatically for REXX Alert() function when the host 
   option to send SNMP traps for the specific alert type is set.
FIX: Host general options dialog would not save the issue command at startup field for the
   SuperVision messages window.
FIX: Host general options dialog would not show the current time stamp setting and would
   not properly save the setting when it was changed.
FIX: The combo boxes on the host general options dialog and the sub-window color dialog would
   allow the user to input invalid data, now they are restricted by what is in the drop down
   list.
FIX: The "Existing connections to this node..." list in the remote connection dialog
   now shows all the existing connections.
MOD: Host window options dialog now allows one to set User Type (0-9) messages
   for Alert Manager forwarding and 
MOD: The general tab in the 3270 options now has three radio buttons for setting the
   Terminal Mode.  Settings include "Auto Detect", "Force CUT", and "Force DFT".
MOD: A new 3270.svk file is put in place as the default. The most notable change in this
   file is that it the broken vertical bar and solid vertical bar are swapped.
MOD: A message is placed in the SuperVision Messages log at startup if a user does not have
   write access to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SuperVision and its subkeys.
MOD: A message box is presented when the Keygroup Selection dialog opened if no write access is
   granted for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SuperVision and its subkeys.  The user will not
   be able to change the loaded keygroup selection but can still see which keygroups
   are loaded.
MOD: If a userid and password are not specified in the 9480 catalog dialog list
   then the currently logged in user's userid and password will be used.  This holds 
   for host the nodename and gateway.
MOD: When a TN3270 session drops and is automatically reconnected, upon reconnect a message
   is added to the SuperVision messages window.
MOD: Users may now specify a window profile to logon with.  This is on the logon dialog box
   and on the windows profile dialog box.

   only.
MOD: The Main Options dialog box has been updated.
MOD: At SV User Logoff time, TN3270 connections are not closed.
NEW: Remote 5250 emulations now have an option to automatically reconnect.
NEW: REXX function StartScript("ScriptName") is implemented.  When REXX calls this function,
   the script window for the specified file and host are opened for the user to interact with.
NEW: REXX function GetDataList has a new query name of SessionInfo.  Data returned includes
   the name and IP address of the SV server host window connection.
NEW: Users may now remove certain toolbar buttons from the toolbar as well as certain
   menu items from the menu; these relate to the following connection types: TN3270,
   3270, 3215, 9074, 5250 and VTxx.

Release 7.0.16                                                 July 23, 2003
=====================                                          ================
FIX: VSE host window attached to VSE console would miss any message identical to
   the previous message.
FIX: Emulation blinking attribute now blinks correctly.
FIX: When SV GUI is showing a system with SV that has at least one emulation window
   GUIS.EXE on the server side would consume a lot of CPU time.
FIX: REXX "Procedure" qualifier prevented correct results from returning from a called
   label.
FIX: The TN3270 reconnect button now works.

   temporarily changed while SV tried to start the exec. (File not found)
MOD: When a TN3270 connection is dropped, the session window will not be closed.
MOD: REXX "Wait" statement should more closely wait the specified time depending
   on system load.
MOD: Host window options dialogs have been redesigned.
MOD: GIS3270 now has an option to reverse the ISA 3270 card load order
   with respect to IO Ports.  This is set in the GIS3270 parameters subkey
   as ISAReverseLoadOrder = (DWORD) 1.
MOD: Support for Host and Emulation window double-buffering (to reduce flicker)
   has been removed.
NEW: Remote host and remote 3270 emulation reconnect option.  A new tab in both the
   3270 emulation and host options dialog allows disconnected sessions to be 
   automatically reestablished.

Release 7.0.15                                                 June 4, 2003

FIX: REXX SV_Admin functions could crash due to a dereference NULL pointer.
FIX: The remote connection dialog box could crash if networks were having problems
     due to a dereferenced NULL pointer.
FIX: When inputting 255 characters from a host window and with traces set to 2 or
     higher a memory over run would occur causing SuperVision to crash.
FIX: When inputting information into a host window with a .usr script file.  If the
     message was 400 or so characters long a memory over run would occur causing
     SuperVision to crash.
FIX: In the connection dialog box, when resolving a host that had no connections to
     resolve, it would appear as though SuperVision couldn't establish contact with
     the host.
FIX: Remote connection dialog does not "jump" when more than 27 entries are
     available

     being acked.
FIX: When 5250 cards are present, when SV starts information will be properly
     reported in the SuperVision messages window.  Before there was always a TWINAX
     error reported.

     "Use inbound message types if available" must be selected.
MOD: The IP Node list allows duplicate connection names if unique gateway is
     specified for each.
MOD: The remote connection dialogs now have a checkbox for "resolve all hosts". If
     it is checked, SuperVision will resolve all hosts in the list. If it is not
     checked, SuperVision will only resolve the hosts which are clicked on.
MOD: A font and color button has been added to the 3270 emulation toolbar.
MOD: SuperVision checks to see if SecureAgent is installed each time one tries to
     login to SuperVision. This means that SuperVision does not need to be restarted
     if SecureAgent is started or stopped on the local machine.

FIX: It was possible to have MCS sticky messages inconsistent
	between an emulation and the attached host.
FIX: REXX function C2X now works correctly.
FIX: An exception condition was corrected in the host windows constructor.
FIX: A deadlock condition existed between an Alert Manager forwarding thread and a 
	REXX calling the Alert function
FIX: Closing a script window could lead to an exception.
MOD: SV_ActionForward now uses the last message "parsed" when supplying "0" as
	the first parameter.
MOD: the OIA Font fits better.
MOD: Commands issued from SVLite are checked against userid/password access.
MOD: Alert Manager forwarding logic has been reworked. We now maintain a queue of messages for each forwarding thread.
NEW: 5250 options dialog has setting for using PC enter key as
	5250 enter key.
NEW: REXX functions BitXOr, BitAnd, BitOr are implemented.
NEW: 3270 options dialog has settings for automatically turning MCS sticky
	messages into alerts.
FIX: The Set Name button was missing from 3270 emulation window's tool bar.
FIX: The names of 3270 emulation windows could not be changed regardless of the user's privilege settings.
MOD: Font resizing for emulation windows was modified.  Now one may choose to have either their font automatically
     resized to their window, or have their window automatically resized to their font.
FIX: Remote emulation windows experienced name changes when a new emulation window was created on the host machine.
FIX: Model settings were not persistent for VTxx connections.  If the user selected a model, shut down SuperVision
     and launched SuperVision the model setting would not always be restored.
NEW: An option was added to the main options dialog to disable Alt + Enter commands in host windows.  The Alt + Enter
     command sends a command entered in a host window to all non-minimized host windows.
FIX: If the user exited SuperVision and opted to not restore connections from logoff, window profiles would also be
     unable to load.
FIX: When creating a new emulation window, the default font size 8; instead of 15.
FIX: The user may resize the window by selecting a font size from the font dialog; this was a side effect of adding
     window/font resizing.
     was being ignored.
FIX: Window positions and sizes were not always being saved; this was a side effect of adding window/font resizing.
FIX: VTxx task control block data; all VTxx connections had an index of 255 instead of their own unique number.
FIX: Changing the model in a VTxx window caused a lot of flicker.
FIX: issuing a command prefixed with a . from an attached host window might not send the command to the emulation window.

Release 7.0.9					October 23, 2002
================================================
FIX: A timing issue was corrected in the remote host connection dialog.  The issue caused
	the resulting host window to behave incorrectly.
FIX: It was possible for a message to be deleted while being sent to a remote
	SuperVision machine.
FIX: As a client, SuperVision 7.0.5 introduced an issue of not correctly
	sending version information to the SuperVision server.
FIX: MCS sticky messages did not show up in remote host windows
FIX: The "Get More History" button on remote host windows caused
	duplicate messages to appear on the server side connection.
FIX: Do not attempt to automatically delete the Alert Manager logs
	when they are in use.  Automatic log deletion after a specified number of days
	is set in SuperVision's Main Options.  Alert Manger logs are created per
	month, not per day as is the case for all other host logs.
FIX: When exiting an emulation option's dialog, the emulation screen would blank-out until
	the next screen update.

MOD: The OIA in emulations will now always use the SuperVision font.
MOD: If a key item (key group) match is found and the key items turns the
	message into a warning, priority, or attention message, the message origin will
	be changed to Alert.  This allows such messages to be forwarded to the Alert Manager.
MOD: Alerts can be sent to the Alert Manager from the SuperVision Messages window
MOD: Automatic Alert forwarding can be stopped by removing the target from the
	Alert Manager's "Forward alerts to:" field.
MOD: Host window option to echo keygroup autoresponses defaults to true.
MOD: The audit window is not hidden when a user logs off.
MOD: When a user Xs out of the main SuperVision window, the logoff dialog is presented.
MOD: Before an alt-enter command (issue commands to all non-minimized host windows) is issued,
	a confirmation dialog is presented and the activity is logged to SuperVision Messages.

NEW: Emulated windows may be resized by dragging and SuperVision will attempt to find
	the closest font matching the new window size.  Windows will snap to the
	closest match.
NEW: Window profile support has been added.  Now window positions can be saved in
	and restored.
	

Release 7.0.8    19th September 2002
================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE:
SuperVision's VTXX support is in a transition state for this release.  If you 
are a user of SuperVision's VTXX functions, you are encouraged to not use this release on any 
SuperVision servers that require VTXX.

FIX: 5250 internal jump on local emulation did not function properly
FIX: 5250 internal jump from remote emulation did not function properly
FIX: 5250 logical terminal settings were not being saved

FIX: While navigating between different SV dialogs, "ghost" images of other application
  sometimes appeared.

FIX: Improved VTxx "more" handling
FIX: REXX strict compare "==" always returned 1
FIX: Remote connection dialogs sometimes would not allow a connection
  to be established.

MOD: The Make New 9074 Connection dialog has been redesigned
MOD: Local 3215 host windows now always show their original LU
MOD: If no access is permitted in setting host or emulation sessions names
  a dialog box will indicate this.
MOD: The "control" menu associated with host windows and emulations now has a 
  print menu item
MOD: The button bar on host windows and emulations now has a print button

  from the initial SV login dialog now shuts down SuperVision
MOD: VTxx host windows have an option to preserve blank lines
MOD: VTxx host windows now issue the "blank command" (enter without anything on command line)


Release 7.0.7                  22nd August 2002
================================================

NEW:  You can now Cut or Copy text to the clipboard from the Scrolling Message
      Window command line.  You can also, if you have the appropriate access
      rights, Paste text from the clipboard to the Scrolling Window command
      line.


NEW:  You can now Copy text to the clipboard from the Scrolling Message Window
      message display area.


NEW:  You can now Copy text to the clipboard from the Emulation screen main
      display and/or OIA area (Live or Instant Replay).


NEW:  Using the new Rexx function SV_Action_Forward() it is now possible to 
		forward each category of alert message as defined in the keygroup to a 
		different target machine.  This allows, for instance all tape-related 
		alert messages to be forwarded to the Alert Manager on a designated 
		machine by simply putting its address as the second argument of the 
		function.  The first argument is reserved for special usage and should 
		always be set to zero.  The second argument is an IP Address (or a 
		space-separated list of Addresses) to forward the message to.


NEW:	Acknowledgements and comments applied to any forwarded alerts will now 
		be propagated, via the origin of the alert, to all locations that 
		received the alert forward.


NEW:	There are three new options on the Alert Manager window.  These allow 
		setting an option to "Pop-up" SuperVision (if it is minimzed) when a new 
		alert is received, an option to "Pop-up" the Alert Manager window if it
		is minimized when a new alert is received and finally an option simply
		to flash the Alert Manager's caption when a new alert arrives.  In the
		latter case the caption will continue flashing as long as the Alert 
		Manager window remains minimized.  All these options can be set from 
		the Alert Manager window Options dialog and by default are inactive.


NEW:  You may now specify up to 10 new sub-categories of message (instead of
      simply Warning, Attention, Priority and Suppressed) in the Automation
      Editor.  These categories are simply labelled User Messages 0-9.  The
      Keygroup directive "Type" will accept values "0" through "9" to define
      these categories.


NEW:	A new option in the Host Options Dialog allows setting the default 
		colour for any message sent to a particular User Message window.  Each 
		User sub-window (0-9) can be given a different default colour.  These 
		colours are used whenever a colour is not specified, for example, in the
		Automation Editor if the colour field is left as "ASIS".


NEW:  You may now specify any one of 16 colours for each message category in
      the Automation Editor.  The Keygroup directive "Colour" ("or Color")
      will now accept the following colour names: "white", "red", "green",
      "yellow", "blue", "magenta", "cyan", "grey" (or "gray"), "pink", "mint",
      "khaki", "violet", "maroon", "navy", "orange" or "brown".


NEW:	A new Rexx function GetDataList("name", stem) provides the ability to 
		request a list of data by name from SuperVision.  In this release the 
		only name available is "Colours" (or "Colors") which returns a list of 
		the official colour names currently supported by SuperVision into a 
		Rexx stem array provided as the second argument.  As usual, the ".0" 
		element indicates how many items there are in the array.


MOD:	The Rexx Alert() function now additionally accepts "0" through "9" as 
		the first argument to support the new sub-categories.  It also accepts,
		as an optional third argument, the name of a colour to be used for this 
		alert to override the default settings.  If the first parameter is "0"
		through "9" and the thrid argument is given as "*" then the default 
		colour for the appropriate sub-window will be used.


MOD:  To enable use of the standard Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V hot keys for Cut,
      Copy and Paste support and to allow users of VTxx sessions to be able to
      use the standard control keys, all the alphabetic "control" hot keys
      now require the 'Shift' key to be pressed in addition to the 'Ctrl' key.
		So, for example, to get the Colour settings dialog the user would now 
		press Shift+Ctrl+C.


MOD:  As long as a user is logged on to SuperVision the Rexx functions Msg() 
		and Send() no longer require the target addresses to be in the 
		IP/Nodelist.  If they are then any extra information such as the gateway 
		address to use or an overriding UserID will be utilised, otherwise the 
		address will be used "as is" with the currently logged-on UserID 
		information.


MOD:	The Command Scheduler now allows issuance of commands on multiple days
		of the week in one entry.  Previously only one day of the week, for
		example "Tuesday", could be specified.  Now up to all seven days in
		a week can be requested as a command repeat settings.  This allows 
		commands to more easily be set for just the weekend or just during the
		week intead of requiring two or five duplicate entries to acheive this.


MOD:	The Command Scheduler now has the ability to not show the commands being 
		issued.  The "Show This Command Being Issued" setting is normally set by 
		default but can be cleared to prevent a command echo being produced.


MOD:	Blank lines in script (.USR) files are now skipped over as if they were 
		comment lines.


MOD:	Ctrl+A through Ctrl+Z will now be properly forwarded from client-side
		Scrolling Message windows connected to server-side Scrolling Message 
		windows which are themselves locally attached to VTxx sessions.


MOD:	When a prefix prompt appears in the command entry area of a VTxx-attached 
		Scrolling Message window, it will properly be reflected to all connected 
		client windows.


MOD:	To prevent undesirable SuperVision forwarding of Alerts to itself, any 
		local IP addresses (including "localhost") are automatically removed 
		from the Alert Manager forwarding address list and any address list 
		supplied to the Rexx SV_ACTION_FORWARD() function.

MOD:	In the remote connection dialogs, if the user does not have access to a
		given session, then that session will not show up.


MOD:	If a message that is longer than 1020 bytes is sent to an emualtion,
		instead of terminating the writer thread, a message will be displayed
		in the SuperVision Messages Window and the writer will continue.

MOD:    POR and reset buttons added to local 5250 emulations


FIX:	It was possible for a command to be entered into a not-fully initialized
		host window causing an exception.

FIX:	Port 514 host windows now remember their address group when reopened

FIX:    It was possible for REXX Send() and Msg() functions to send to the wrong 
		host window.

FIX:    A deadlock situation in which a remote connection was being made at the same
		time data was being sent to a host log from an emulation has been fixed.

FIX:    It was possible for the redraw scheduler to act on a window that was deleted.

FIX:    Host window startup commands are now issued at profile load time.

FIX:    REXX call to a non-existant label did not terminate the REXX exec.


FIX:	It was possible for a the main SuperVision toolbar to be referenced
		before it was initialized.


FIX:    If a Rexx program terminated unexpectedly while it had files open, these
		files could sometimes be left locked out until Supervision was shutdown.
		This has been corrected to properly close any files opened by prematurely 
		terminating Rexx Programs (including those terminated via the built-in 
		".STOP" command).


FIX:	It was possible, under certain circumstances, to set two (or more) 
		Scrolling Message windows to have the same name.  This led to several 
		message and command routing problems.  This has been corrected.


FIX:	The heartbeat icon display, indicating the health of a remote connection,
		did not always disply on the remote session toolbar.  This has been 
		corrected.


FIX:	If a server-side session was closed the client-side sessions did not 
		always recognize this state and would simply appear to be unresponsive.
		This has been corrected and the client-sdie windows will be closed 
		automatically if the server-side is closed.


FIX:  The first line of a TPF 3270 emulation display was not always picking up
      the associated colour when being copied to an attached Scrolling Message
      window.  This has been corrected.


FIX:  An error in the 3270 display of an IBM MVS or OS/390 master console could
      lead to SuperVision mistaking an existing message block as a new set of
      messages and copying them to the attached Srolling Message Window.
      SuperVision now recognises this errant case and allows for the fault in
      the 3270 display if it occurs.


FIX:	In a Rexx program, if a call to an external module of the form:
		
			CALL name params

		...was specified incorrectly as:

			CALL name.REX params

		...it caused problems internally when processing the file path.  This 
		will no longer cause a problem and the ".rex" extension, if provided, is
		recognised and then ignored by the interpreter.


FIX:  A Rexx floating-point interpretation error which would accept a single
      decimal point as a valid number (equal to zero) has been corrected.




Release 7.0.3                    10th April 2002
================================================

FIX:  Forwarding Alerts to non-responsive systems could appear to freeze the
      SuperVision display while the sending thread was waiting for a timeout
      period.  The sending thread(s) an the log/screen update thread have been
      made fully independent to prevent this.


FIX:  Forwarding addresses in the Alert Manager options dialog will now match
      addresses in the selection list regardless of case.


FIX:  It was possible to connect back to emulations multiple times from a
      single forwarded Alert Manager note.  Now, if an existing session to
      that emulation already exists if will be 'popped' to the front if a
      second connect back is attempted.


FIX:  Locally generated alerts from the Rexx Alert fucntion were not being
      properly recognised by the connect back logic.  This has been corrected.




Release 7.0.2                    28th March 2002
================================================
(Note: Service Pack 2 includes all the changes in Service Pack One which had
       been pre-released to selected customers requiring urgent changes.)


NEW:  Toolbars can be switched off by de-selecting the "Show All Toolbars"
      option from the Main Options dialog.


NEW:  VTxxPress(device,keyword) now accepts two new keywords:

         "disconnect" will disconnect the local VTxx device.
         "reconnect" will reconnect the local VTxx device.

      Please note that "reconnect" will first disconnect the device if it is
      already connected.


NEW:  Rexx function StatusDisplay() allows two lines of status information to
      be added at the bottom of a Scrolling Message window if required.
      Status information can easily be arranged in column format, title and
      data style.  Colours can be set use "escape" sequences.  The escape
      character is the tilde (~).  The single (case-insensitive) character
      immediately following the tilde can be one of the following with the
      indicated meaning:

         B - Set text colour to Blue
         C - Set text colour to Cyan
         G - Set text Colour to Green
         K - Set text Colour to Khaki
         M - Set text Colour to Magenta
         O - Set text Colour to Orange
         P - Set text Colour to Pink
         R - Set text Colour to Red
         S - Set text Colour to Silver (light grey)
         T - Set text Colour to Turquoise (same as cyan)
         V - Set text Colour to Violet
         W - Set text Colour to White
         Y - Set text Colour to Yellow

         I - Inverted text (Reverse Video)
         N - Normal text
         D - Set text to the default colour for this line.  The default colour
            for line 1 is blue and for line 2 is green.

      Any other character after the tilde will be displayed as a regular
      character so to display a tilde simply put two tildes together.

      The first line is considered a title line with the second line being the
      "data" line.  For the data line only you may embed ASCII Line-Feed
      characters using the Rexx function Char(10) to produce multiple data
      lines.  The maximum length of the title line is 512 characters.  The
      maximum length of all the data lines together is 5120 characters.
      If the data line is set to the null string ("") then only the title
      line will be displayed.  If the title line is set to the null string
      then the status display is switched off altogether.


NEW:  Rexx function CallStack() populates a stem variable (the only argument)
      with the sequence of external function calls leading to the current
      routine.  As usual, stem.0 contains the number of entries.  The first
      item will show the initial call from SuperVision to start the Rexx
      program and subsequent items show each external call.  The highest
      indexed item will be the current routine.  The format of each line is
      as follows:

         Called_from_environment: "full path of program file" arguments

      Example call:     x = CallStack("progs")
      ...may give:

         progs.0 = 2
         progs.1 = SuperVision: "C:\REXX\TEST.REX" testing
         progs.2 = Rexx: "C:\REXX\SUB1.REX" some other test data


MOD:  Rexx Tracing will now indicate the call stack for external routines.


MOD:  External Rexx functions can now exist anywhere on the "Rexx Path"
      specified on the Main Option/Rexx Configuration dialog.  Previously
      Rexx external routines had to be in the same directory.


MOD:  The Rexx function SetHostName() for 3215 Escon connections can now
      accept the special "new" name of "default" to restore the original LU
      name used to make the connection.  It will also accept "*" as the "old"
      name to indicate the current Hosy session.  So to reset the current
      session to the original name, use x=SetHostName("*","default").  The
      New Name dialog will also accept the special name of "default" for 3215
      connections.


MOD:  Unecessary command echo on remote Scrolling Message windows have been
      eliminated.  Only one echo should be produced (excluding any echos
      produced by any operating system running on the console the Scrolling
      Message window may be attached to).


MOD:  The automatic issue of "K" and "K E,1" commands to MCS consoles have
      been separated into two separate options.  For backwards compatiblilty,
      if the previous option had been set then both new options will be set.





Release 7.0                   27th February 2002
================================================
NEW:  Audit log
---------------
SuperVision now monitors all inbound connections and keeps a log of all
connections, disconnections and any commands entered via those connections.
The Audit window is only visible if the user is logged on with SV Admin access
to the SuperVision Messages window.

NEW:  Central Alert Viewer
--------------------------
SuperVision now allows entries for the Alert Viewer window to come directly
from sessions on other nodes via new Host Options and an extension of the Rexx
ALERT() function.  The new Alert Viewer also allows connecting back to those
remotes sessions automatically when an Alert is selected.

NEW:  Comments on Messages
--------------------------
Any Host produced message (or received Alert) can now be commented on by using
the right mouse button to click on the message and adding a comment in the
dialog that appears.  This dialog also allows various other actions to be
carried out such as sending the message as an e-mail or forwarding the messages
asan alert to another SuperVision/Alert Viewer session.  If the mouse is placed
over a message with an attached comment (indicated by a green '=' sign in the
left margin) a tool-tip will pop-up showing all the comments for that message.

NEW:  DFT NON-SNA multiple session suppprt
------------------------------------------
With a 3270 running in DFT mode (non-SNA) it is now possible to have up to 5
sessions running simultaneously over one COAX cable and 3270 adapter.  The
first session is known as the 'master' session with up to four 'slave'
sessions based on whether they have been 'genned' on the 3174/3274 controller.
In the title bar of each DFT session will be an indicator of the form "Dn:Sm",
where "D" stands for "Device number" followed by the device number (1 to 255)
and "S" stands for "Session number" (within the Device) followed by the session
number (1 to 5).

NEW:  9240 ESCON support
------------------------
SuperVision now supports connections to 3215 type terminal devices (used by the
TPF operating system) and 3270 devices via the IDG 9074 Escon controller.

NEW:  UNIX/Linux Syslog support
-------------------------------
Various UNIX/Linux system send logging message via UDP port 514 to a syslog
daemon, often on a dedicated machine.  SuperVision can now act as that daemon
but with the added facility of splitting syslog traffic from different groups
of systems into individual logs viewable via standard scrolling message
windows.  These messages can also be automated using all the built-in
facilities already available for other systems.

NEW:  Rexx function GetNetHosts
-------------------------------
A new Rexx function is available which gathers a list of all the available
Scrolling Message (Host) sessions into a Rexx stem variable.  It is:

   GetNetHosts("NODE","STEM")

Where "NODE" is the name of a SuperVision node from the IP/Nodelist and "STEM"
is the name of a Rexx stem (array) variable.  Upon return, STEM.0 will contain
the number of sessions listed in the STEM.1 to STEM.n elements of the array.

NEW:  Rexx functions to interact with Command Scheduler
-------------------------------------------------------
A new set of Rexx functions to allow programs to interact with the SuperVision
Command Scheduler have been added.  They are:

  SVScheduleAdd(session_name,command_text,date/time,[RepeatType,RepeatValue])
  SVScheduleDisable(ID#)
  SVScheduleEnable(ID#)
  SVScheduleList(list_stem_name[,session_name_filter])
  SVScheduleRemove(ID#)

The 'Add' routine adds a new active item for the given session name.  If the
name is left blank or "*" then the current session name is used.  The date time
can be given as a simple number of minutes (from now) or as a string containing
a date and time in the format "yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm".  The year can be given as a
two digit year between 01 and 38 or as a four digit year between 2001 and 2038
or left off altogether (along with the separating slash) and this year will be
assumed.  Similarly with the month and day.  If just the time (hh:mm) is given
then today's date is assumed.  If a repeating Schedule entry is needed then
the optional RepeatType parameter must be provided as one of the following:

  "Weekday", "CalendarDay", "Minutes", "Hours", or "Days"

Only the first character is needed and is used to identify the type of repeat.
For the "W" option the next parameter (RepeatValue) must be given as the name
of the weekday, such as "Monday, "Tuesday", etc.  Enough of the name must be
provided to identify which weekday is given, for example "Thursday" must be
given as at least "TH" to differentiate it from "Tuesday" ("TU") although
"Friday" can be given simply as "F" if so desired.  For the other repeat types
the RepeatValue argument must be a positive integer greater than 0 and less
than 32768 (in the case of "CalendarDay" it must be less than 32).

The 'List' routine lists all the Scheduled items into a Rexx stem given as the
first argument.  The second argument is optional and allows restriction of the
item list to a given session.  If "*" is provided as the second argument then
only the current session's entries will be returned.  Each entry returned will
have, as the first word, an item number.  This can be passed to the other
functions that need an item number to reference the particular entry.  Each
entry will be as follows:

  ID# 'Session name' AAA YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM RRR NNN Command

The session name is enclosed in single quotes to facilitate easy parsing of a
possibly multi-word name.  "AAA" is a single word either ACTIVE or INACTIVE to
indicate whether this item is currently active or not.  "YY/MM/DD" is the date
of the next invocation of the command; "HH:MM" is the time.  "RRR" is a
single word indicating the repetition type of the command such as ONCE,
WEEKDAY, CALENDARDAY, MINUTE, HOUR or DAY.  "NNN" is a single word indicating
the repetion value.  For the "ONCE" type, the repetition interval will always
be the word "ONLY".  For the "WEEKDAY" type the repetion interval is the name
of a weekday (such as "Saturday").  For the "CALENDARDAY" it is the day of
the month (1-31) on which to issue the command.  For "MINUTE", "HOUR" and
"DAY" it is a value indicating the number of minutes, hours or days
respectively.  The ID# is unique to each entry and will not be reused or reset
unless all Scheduled commands are removed at which time it will reset to 1
again.  If entries are deleted is it normal to have be gaps in the sequence of
the ID numbers.  This ID# is used to uniquely refer to a given entry when
using the other access routines.

NEW:  .DUMPALL command
----------------------
Issuing this command from any Scrolling Message window command area will cause
the SuperVision Messages window to pop-up and a list of all currently active
threads, versions of loaded drivers and DLLs to be dumped to it.

NEW:  Attribute Display on Emulation Screens
--------------------------------------------
If SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+A is pressed while an emulation screen has focus then the
appropriate attribute charateristics will be displayedin place of the actual
text normally displayed.  A 'P' indicates a protected field, a 'u' inicates
an unprotected field.  Colours indicate the colour attributes.  Blinking,
underline and reverse video characters are displayed as such.

MOD:  Rexx-Only WIndows
-----------------------
A session created just for Rexx interaction (Rexx-Only) will not be closed
when a user logs off but will be restored (if necessary) when the user logs
back on.

MOD:  3270 Status indicator
---------------------------
Local 3270 sessions will now indicate in their status bar whether they are
running in CUT mode, DFT mode or TN3270.  Also in DFT mode a numeric indicator
(S:2, S:3, S:4 or S:5) on the title bar of each emulation will appear if it is
one of the four 'slave' DFT sessions rather than the 'master' session.  Remote
3270 sessions will indicate DFT or CUT based on data retreived from the OIA.

MOD:  TN3270 support for Visara Controllers
-------------------------------------------
The SuperVision TH3270 sessions now detect and employ the appropriate
work-arounds for certain non-standard behaviour by some Visara controllers.

MOD:  Host colours
------------------
The number of colours available for highlighting messages has been increased
from eight to sixteen.  These colours can be manually specified in keygroup
files by adding a "Colour=xxxx" directive to any given keyword (where xxxx is
one of the following colour names: White, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta,
Cyan, Grey (or Gray), Pink, Mint, Khaki, Violet, Maroon, Navy, Orange and
Brown).

MOD:  Troubleshooting Wizard update
-----------------------------------
The messages provided by the SuperVision Troubleshooting Wizard have been
adjusted to give more relevant messages on TN3270 sessions.

MOD:  Restoration of Remote Sessions and Window positions
---------------------------------------------------------
Remote Scrolling window and 3270 sessions (including TN3270 sessions) will
now be restored when the same user logs-on again to SuperVision.  Session
names and other options should also be restored upon log-on.

MOD:  GetEnvironmentData() - new keywords
-----------------------------------------
The GetEnvironmentData function now has some new keywords:
DRIVE       - returns the drive the Rexx program is running from, eg. "C:"
DIRECTORY   - returns the full directory path the Rexx program is running
               from, eg. "C:\Program Files\SuperVision\REXX\"
FULLNAME    - returns the fully qualified name of the running Rexx program,
               eg. "C:\Program Files\SuperVision\REXX\TEST1.REX"
REXXNAME    - returns just the name of the running Rexx program without any
               extension or path, eg. "TEST1"
SV_REXXPATH - returns the list of paths to be seacrhed when looking for Rexx
               programs.  Each path with be separated by a semi-colon (;) in
               the ususal manner.  There will always be a trailing semi-colon.

MOD:  .HELP searches Rexx path
------------------------------
The .HELP command will now parse trhough the Rexx search path (if defined) to
find HELP sub-directories containing help text files.  Note:  It uses the new
"SV_REXXPATH" keyword of the GetEnviromentData() function to do this.
Also, if now help file name is given then a list of all available help files
will be displayed.

FIX:  Auto-scroll on VTxx-attached Message window
-------------------------------------------------
Pausing the auto-scroll feature on a Scrolling Message window that was
attached to a VTxx session would unpause every time a screen update arrived
on the VTxx session.  This has been corrected.

FIX:  International keyboards could not enter all keys
------------------------------------------------------
Certain keys on non-US keyboards require the use of the ALT_GR (right hand ALT
key) to be pressed in order to generate the character.  All ALT keys, except
ALT+ENTER, were being suppressed on the Scrolling Message command line which
prevented the 'international' keys from being activated.  This restriction has
been lifted and the extra characters can now be entered properly.

FIX:  Administrator privilege required
--------------------------------------
SuperVision required the logged-on NT or W2K user to have NT administrator
privilege to test for the installation of the SecureAgent service.  This caused
SuperVision to not detect SecureAgent properly even when it was installed and
therefore all existing sessions were set to Read-Only access.  This requirement
has been lifted and any user privilege level is now sufficient to detect the
existence of the SecureAgent service.   Message numbers SVM8007I and SVM8008E
have been created in the SuperVision Messages log to indicate detection of
SecureAgent or not, respectively.  If detection fails for a reason other than
the SecureAgent service not actually being installed, then a message SVM8009E
will provide the reason for failure.

FIX:  Incorrect Script processing when encountering /*/
-------------------------------------------------------
When the script encountered the character sequence /*/ in a script line it
became confused as the /*...*/ sequence had been implemented as form of
commenting and processing of the /*/ sequence left the position pointer in an
invalid position.  The /*...*/ style of commenting in Scripts was experimental
and has been discontinued as it is possible that system commands may contain
this sequence of characters as genuine input.  the only remaing possibilities
for commenting are to start a line with the asterisk character (*) or to place
an exclamation point (!) before any trailing comments on a line.

FIX:  Error during Scrolling Message Window attachment
------------------------------------------------------
If an emulatiopn session was closed in the background (due to asynchronous
connectivitychanges) while the user is in the dialog selecting a session for
attachment of a scrolling message window, SuperVision could take an exception
and shut down. This has been corrected.
